'''7. Banking Withdrawal Limit System


A bank wants to set withdrawal limits based on the available account balance:

* Balance less than ₹1000 → Withdrawal not allowed
* ₹1000 to ₹5000 → Maximum withdrawal ₹1000
* Above ₹5000 → Maximum withdrawal ₹5000

Write a Python program to display the withdrawal limit.

Input:
Enter account balance: 3500

Output:
Maximum Withdrawal Limit: ₹1000
'''
bal=int(input("Enter account balance: "))
if bal<1000:
    limit=0
elif bal>=1000 and bal<5000:
    limit=1000
else:
    limit=5000
print("Maximum Withdrawal Limit: ₹",limit)
