'''4. E-Commerce Discount Engine


An online shopping platform provides discounts to customers based on their total purchase amount:

* Above ₹5000 → 20% discount
* ₹2000 to ₹5000 → 10% discount
* Below ₹2000 → 5% discount

Write a Python program to calculate the final amount after discount.

Input:
Enter purchase amount: 4500

Output:
Final Amount: ₹4050
'''
amt=int(input("Enter purchase amount: "))
if amt<2000:
    dis=(amt*5)//100
elif amt>=2000 and amt<5000:
    dis=(amt*10)//100
else:
    dis=(amt*20)//100
final=amt-dis
print("Final Amount: ",final)
